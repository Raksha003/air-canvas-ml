# Description
In this project the user can draw in the screen itself on a real time using their hand gestures and finger movements. If we want to use it on a live meeting or virtual conference we can use this to draw and showcase our thiughts on a real time basis just by using your hand gestures. We have implemented this project using the mediapipe to track the hand movements of the user and used OpenCV library for implementing the computer vision requirements. The language used in this project is python.
# Requirements (to be installed in your system):
